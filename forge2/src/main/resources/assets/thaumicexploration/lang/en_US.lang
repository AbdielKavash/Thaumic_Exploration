----Thaumonomicon Entries----
te.researchPrefix=[TX]
tc.research_category.TAINT=Tainturgy

--Flesh Curing
te.name.FLESHCURE=Flesh Purification
te.tag.FLESHCURE=Mystical Cleansing
te.text.FLESHCURE.1=By imbuing rotten flesh with certain aspects, you have found that you are able to remove nearly all traces of disease and decomposition from the flesh, rendering it much more useful. Although this discovery may not be particularly useful, you are sure it will lead to exciting things.

--Brain Curing
te.name.BRAINCURE=Brain Sanitization
te.tag.BRAINCURE=Brain washing
te.text.BRAINCURE.1=You have discovered that by using a process similar to purifying zombie villagers, you can reverse the effects of zombification on the brain. These cured brains exhibit much more intellectual capacity than their diseased counterparts, so you hope they will prove useful in future creations.<BR><BR>Note that any type and any duration of weakening potion will work.
TO BE IMPLEMENTED: The brains also serve as a bait for zombified creatures, when dropped or placed on an arcane pedestal.

--Think Tank
te.name.THINKTANK=Think Tank
te.tag.THINKTANK=All the way from the Big MT
te.text.THINKTANK.1=Your search for a way to automate research has finally come to an end. You have found that purified zombie brains make the perfect research aide. Placing a few of them in a warded jar with some thaumic devices and supplying them with an ample amount of books will result in a quantity of knowledge fragments. The system is not perfect, and the supplied books are destroyed in the process.
te.text.THINKTANK.2=This 'think tank' has very particular placement requirements. To construct a working think tank, you must place the tank on top of a bookshelf, with nothing occupying the space in a 3x3x3 cube around the tank except for the bookshelf it is placed on. Note that a wand does not need to be used when setting up your think tank.

--Chest Sealing
te.name.CHESTSEAL=Seal of Chest Binding
te.tag.CHESTSEAL=Magical inventory linking
te.text.CHESTSEAL.1=By soaking a mundane seal made of tallow in a concoction of essentia, you have discovered a way to bind chests so that they share their contents. These seals can be dyed various colors for sorting purposes, but an unlimited number of bound chest networks can be created.<BR><BR>By right clicking on a chest with a chest binding seal, you can create a new network. Right clicking on a bound chest will link the seal to that network. Right clicking on an unbound chest with a linked seal will add that chest to the linked network. Note that only empty chests are able to be bound.

--Jar Sealing
te.name.JARSEAL=Seal of Jar Binding
te.tag.JARSEAL=Essentia, essentia everywhere
te.text.JARSEAL.1=By adjusting the mixture of aspects that you soak the tallow seal in to account for essentia's mystical properties, you have found that you are able to bind essentia containers, in particular, warded jars. Much like your previous binding seals, the jar binding seal can be dyed and an unlimited amount of networks can be created.<BR><BR>See your notes on bound chest seals for information on how to create networks. Note that only empty jars are able to be bound. You can not bind void jars or jars with labels.<BR><BR>Sealed jars have a higher suction than unlabeled jars but lower than labeled jars.

--Everfull Urn
te.name.URN=Everfull Urn
te.tag.URN=It seems familiar... 
te.text.URN.1=You have read much about an 'Everfull Urn' in your research, a mystical device created by the great Thaumaturge Azanor that could fill an infinite amount of buckets. You have finally been able to devise a device that can do that and more. Your everfull urn can not only supply water to an infinite amount of buckets, it can also be pumped out of the top to an external tank. Your urn also has the ability to fill any nearby crucible, and extinguish nearby players that are on fire.

--Crucible of Souls
te.name.CRUCSOULS=Crucible of Souls
te.tag.CRUCSOULS=Caution: Keep out of reach of children.
te.text.CRUCSOULS.1=You have discovered a way to take advantage of a previously untapped source of essentia - that of living creatures. Infusing an alchemical furnace with various occult reagents and precise quantities of essentia, will create a crucible of souls, a device that will seek out the nearest living creature and slowly drain their life force, retrieving essentia at the final blow. This comes at the cost of the normal loot the creature would drop. This essentia can then be piped out of any face except the top via essentia tubes.
te.text.CRUCSOULS.2=The crucible of souls is very unstable, and has a high probability of converting some of the essentia to flux or breaking it down into its component parts. You should make preparations to dispose of this flux before it causes a problem.<BR><BR>You have managed to install a basic safeguard so the device will not attack humans, but keep your pets at a safe distance.

--Replicator
te.name.REPLICATOR=Thaumic Replicator
te.tag.REPLICATOR=Equivalent exchange
te.text.REPLICATOR.1=You have been able to break down blocks and items into essentia with an alchemical furnace, now finally you have found a way to do the opposite. You have created a device that can replicate simple building blocks using essentia.<BR><BR>By right clicking the Thaumic Replicator with a block, you can set the template. Right clicking with a wand starts the replication process. Simply look at the Replicator with Goggles of Revealing to see what essentia is neccesary, and place this essentia in nearby jars like you would for an infusion.
te.text.REPLICATOR.2=This essentia will then form into the block that you set as a template. This block must be removed before starting the process again. Right clicking will remove any blocks in the replicator and right clicking again will reset the template.<BR><BR>This process can also be automated by starting replication with a redstone signal and removing blocks with a hopper.

--Amber Wand Core
te.name.WANDAMBER=Amber Wand Core
te.tag.WANDAMBER=Regenerative vis storage
te.text.WANDAMBER.1=You have finally found a practical use for amber, in the form of a wand core. Amber serves as a poor conduit for vis, and thus can only hold 10 vis of each type, but it has other benefits. Amber cores seem to store a fleeting memory of vis when empty. By harnessing this memory, you have created a wand core that can replenish all forms of vis at a rather quick rate when below 50% capacity. While many of the other wand cores you have created have had regenerative properties, the amber core regenerates one point of every type of vis, instead of one type in particular, at three times the rate.

--Wispy Dreamcatcher
te.name.DREAMCATCHER=Wispy Dreamcatcher
te.tag.DREAMCATCHER=Filtered thoughts
te.text.DREAMCATCHER.1=They say that dreamcatchers are meant to stop nightmares from reaching the mind. Though taint may not be a construct of your psyche, you think that perhaps the ill effects that taint has on the body could be combated using a modified dreamcatcher. If you hold this dreamcatcher in your hotbar, it will have a high probability of nullifying damage from taint or tainted creatures. Although this dreamcatcher does not nullify all damage, it will certainly make excursions into tainted land much less dangerous.

--Talisman of Nourishment
te.name.TALISMANFOOD=Talisman of Nourishment
te.tag.TALISMANFOOD=Everfull belly
te.text.TALISMANFOOD.1=You often find yourself needing to take breaks during marathon researching sessions to satisfy your hunger. Finally you have found a way to get past your need for food.<BR><BR>By infusing a diamond with the essence of hunger, you have created an item that is able to suck the nourishing energy from various food items in your hotbar and store this energy within. It will then automatically replenish your food meter if it is depleted.<BR><BR>This device will only work on simple food items, so foods that invoke effects such as Rotten Flesh and Golden Apples must be consumed normally.

--Disarming Enchantment
te.name.ENCHDISARM=Enchantment: Disarming
te.tag.ENCHDISARM=Fighting dirty
te.text.ENCHDISARM.1=You have formulated an enchantment that has a slight chance of knocking a weapon from a creature's hands.<BR><BR>This enchantment can be applied to swords. When done so, struck creatures have a chance of dropping the weapon they are holding. This disarming effect does not work on other players. This enchantment has a better chance of success if it is a higher level.

--Binding Enchantment
te.name.ENCHBINDING=Enchantment: Binding
te.tag.ENCHBINDING=Going somewhere?
te.text.ENCHBINDING.1=You have formulated an enchantment that binds a struck creature to a certain location.<BR><BR>This enchantment can be applied to swords. When a creature is struck with a sword enchanted with the first level of this enchantment, they will be slowed temporarily. Attacking an enderman with a sword that carries the second level of this enchantment will stop the enderman from teleporting away. Creepers struck with a blade that holds the second level of this enchantment will not be able to explode for a short time afterward.

--Night Vision Enchantment
te.name.ENCHNIGHTVISION=Enchantment: Night Vision
te.tag.ENCHNIGHTVISION=Low-light vision
te.text.ENCHNIGHTVISION.1=You have formulated an enchantment that allows you to see in the dark.<BR><BR>This enchantment can be applied to headgear. When done so, the wearer is able to see in low light conditions, similarly to using a night vision potion.

--Boots of the Meteor
te.name.METEORBOOTS=Boots of the Meteor
te.tag.METEORBOOTS=Come on and slam
te.text.METEORBOOTS.1=Your Boots of the Traveller have been very useful, but sometimes you have desired even more mobility. By imbuing the Boots of the Traveller with the raw power of Ignis and Potentia, you have created a pair of boots with unrivaled mobility. These boots propel the wearer with the force of a meteor in the direction they are looking, if they jump while crouching. Pressing the crouch button when in midair will launch the player towards the ground at incredible speeds, damaging anything near the point of impact.

--Boots of the Comet
te.name.COMETBOOTS=Boots of the Comet
te.tag.COMETBOOTS=Ice ice baby
te.text.COMETBOOTS.1=The Boots of the Traveller are fast, but you think that there is room for improvement. By infusing the Boots of the Traveller with Aqua and Gelum, you have created a pair of boots with unrivaled speed. These boots allow the user to run with the speed of a comet, covering large tracts of land in a matter of seconds. Water can do nothing to slow you. When wearing the Boots of the Comet, water will be temporarily frozen under your feet.

--Transmutative Wand Core
te.name.TRANSMUTATION=Transmutative Wand Core
te.tag.TRANSMUTATION=One thing into another
te.text.TRANSMUTATION.1=While experimenting with different materials to filter vis, you have found that diamonds can sporadically convert one form of vis into another. You have found this property to be too unreliable to use for most purposes, but you have found that if infused with certain materials, it can be used as a wand core with unique properties. When draining a node of vis at over 90% capacity, the vis will be converted into other forms of vis.

--Taint Basics
te.name.TAINTBASICS=Taint
te.tag.TAINTBASICS=Henturgy
te.text.TAINTBASICS.1=Sometimes, Thaumaturgy goes horribly wrong. Miracles become twisted calamities and the very landscape twists into hideous forms. Tainted Lands are places infected by the sick runoff of magical workings, flux. Local flora and fauna become warped and mutated into forms hostile to normal life and the very ground of a tainted land infects those who tread upon its pulsing fibres.
te.text.TAINTBASICS.2=Tainted Lands can be found naturally in the world, but can also form when a careless Thaumaturge allows flux goo to stagnate for too long. They are recognizable by their telltale purple fibres and bright violet stalks. Left alone, the tainted land will gradually extend its tendrils outwards, infecting more and more of the surrounding land. Dirt becomes thick, pulpy Tainted Soil while trees and other natural materials are slowly covered in fibres and converted into structurally unsound crust which can collapse or melt into flux goo at any moment.
